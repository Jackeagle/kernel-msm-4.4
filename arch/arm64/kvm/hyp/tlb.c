	 * I-cache lines allocated with a different VMID, we don't need
	 * to worry about junk out of guest reset (we nuke the I-cache on
	 * VMID rollover), but we do need to be careful when remapping
	 * executable pages for the same guest. This can happen when KSM
	 * takes a CoW fault on an executable page, copies the page into
	 * a page that was previously mapped in the guest and then needs
	 * to invalidate the guest view of the I-cache for that page
	 * from EL1. To solve this, we invalidate the entire I-cache when
	 * unmapping a page from a guest if we have a VPIPT I-cache but
	 * the host is running at EL1. As above, we could do better if
	 * we had the VA.
	 *
	 * The moral of this story is: if you have a VPIPT I-cache, then
	 * you should be running with VHE enabled.
