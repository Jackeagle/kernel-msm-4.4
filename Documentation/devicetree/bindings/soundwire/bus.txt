Soundwire bus

SoundWire is a 2-pin multi-drop interface with data and clock line.
It facilitates development of low cost, efficient, high performance systems.

Required property for Soundwire controller node:

Required properties:
- #address-cells	- Should be 1
- #size-cell		- Should be 0 
Rest of the controller bindings are very much specific to vendor.

Child nodes:
Every Soundwire controller node can contain zero or more child nodes
representing slave devices on the bus. Every Soundwire slave device is
uniquely determined by the enumeration address containing 5 fields:
Soundwire Version, Instance ID, Manufacturer ID, Part ID and Class ID
for a device.

Required property for SLIMbus child node if it is present:
- reg		- Should be ('Instance ID') from Soundwire
		  Enumeration  Address.
		  Instance ID Is for the cases where multiple Devices of the
		  same type or Class are attached to the bus.

- compatible	-"swrVER,MFD,PID,CID". The textual representation of
		  Soundwire Version, Manufacturer ID, Part ID, shall be
		  in lower case hexadecimal with leading zeroes suppressed
		  Version number '0x10' represents SoundWire 1.0
		  Version number '0x11' represents SoundWire 1.1
		

Soundwire example for Qualcomm's soundwire controller:

	soundwire@c2d0000 {
		compatible = "qcom,soundwire-v1.5.0"
		reg = <0x0c2d0000 0x2000>;
		...
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cell = <0>;

		wsa8810@0{
			compatible = "swr10,217,211,0";
			reg = <0>;
		};

		wsa8810@1{
			compatible = "swr10,217,211,0";
			reg = <1>;
		};
	};
