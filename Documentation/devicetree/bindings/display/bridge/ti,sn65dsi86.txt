SN65DSI86 DSItoeDP bridge chip
------------------------------

This is the binding for Texas Instruments SN65DSI86 bridge.

Required properties:

- compatible: Must be "ti,sn65dsi86"
- reg:					Main I2C slave ID (for I2C host driver)
- sn,irq-gpio:				Main IRQ gpio mapping
- sn,enable-gpio			Main reset gpio mapping

Required nodes:

This device has two video ports. Their connections are modelled using the OF
graph bindings specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

- Video port 0 for DSI input
- Video port 1 for eDP output

Example
-------

vga-bridge {
	compatible = "ti,sn65dsi86";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	reg = <0x39>;

	sn,irq-gpio = <&msmgpio 32 0>;
	sn,enable-gpio = <&msmgpio 33 0>;

	ports {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;

			vga_bridge_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&dsi_out>;
			};
		};

		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;

			vga_bridge_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&edp_in>;
			};
		};
	};
}
