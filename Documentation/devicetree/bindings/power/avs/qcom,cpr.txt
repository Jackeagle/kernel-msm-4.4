QCOM CPR (Core Power Reduction)

CPR (Core Power Reduction) is a technology to reduce core power on a CPU
or other device. Each OPP of a device corresponds to a "corner" that has
a range of valid voltages for a particular frequency. While the device is
running at a particular frequency, CPR monitors dynamic factors such as
temperature, etc. and suggests adjustments to the voltage to save power
and meet silicon characteristic requirements.
