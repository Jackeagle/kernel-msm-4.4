* Qualcomm SDHCI controller (sdhci-msm)

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties used by the sdhci-msm driver.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should contain "qcom,sdhci-msm-v4" or "qcom,sdhci-msm-v5".
		 For SDCC version 5.0.0, MCI registers are removed from SDCC
		 interface and some registers are moved to HC. New compatible
		 string is added to support this change - "qcom,sdhci-msm-v5".
- reg: Base address and length of the register in the following order:
	- Host controller register map (required)
	- SD Core register map (required)
- interrupts: Should contain an interrupt-specifiers for the interrupts:
	- Host controller interrupt (required)
- pinctrl-names: Should contain only one value - "default".
- pinctrl-0: Should specify pin control groups used for this controller.
- clocks: A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs for the clocks listed in clock-names.
- clock-names: Should contain the following:
	"iface" - Main peripheral bus clock (PCLK/HCLK - AHB Bus clock) (required)
	"core"	- SDC MMC clock (MCLK) (required)
	"bus"	- SDCC bus voter clock (optional)
	"xo"	- TCXO clock (optional)
	"cal"	- reference clock for RCLK delay calibration (optional)
	"sleep"	- sleep clock for RCLK delay calibration (optional)
- <supply-name>-supply: phandle to the regulator device tree node if voltage
		regulators needs to be handled from within sdhci-msm layer.
		Supported "supply-name" are "vdd" and "vdd-io".

Optional Properties:
	- qcom,<supply>-always-on - specifies whether supply should be kept
		"on" always.
	- qcom,<supply>-lpm_sup - specifies whether supply can be kept in low
		power mode (lpm).
	- qcom,<supply>-voltage_level - specifies voltage levels for supply.
		Should be specified in pairs (min, max), units uV.
	- qcom,<supply>-current_level - specifies load levels for supply in lpm
		or high power mode (hpm). Should be specified in
		pairs (lpm, hpm), units uA.
